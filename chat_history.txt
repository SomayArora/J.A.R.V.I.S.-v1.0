Here are the key ways to set the volume level to 100% using the command line on Linux, Windows, and macOS:

### Linux:

On most Linux distributions, you can use the `amixer` command:

```
amixer sset Master 100%
```

Alternatively, you can use `alsamixer`:

```
alsamixer
```

Then press F6 to switch to the master channel and use the arrow keys to increase the volume to 100%.

### Windows:

On Windows, you can use the `wmic` command:

```
wmic audio device get name,deviceid
wmic path win32_volume set Caption="Volume Level: 100%"
```

Or use PowerShell:

```
Set-AudioDevice -Name "Default Device" -Volume 100
```

### macOS:

On macOS, you can use the `osascript` command:

```
osascript -e 'set volume output volume 100'
```

### General Tips:

- Replace "Master" with the specific audio channel name if needed (e.g., "Headphone", "Line").
- Some systems may require root/sudo privileges to modify volume levels.
- The exact syntax might vary slightly depending on your specific system configuration.

Remember to adjust the command based on your specific audio setup and preferences.
